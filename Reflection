Description: Briefly describe your game and customization. 
My game is called First Person Purge or FPP. I started with a I added customizations that include things that are decorative and things that aren't decorative that makes the game harder.



Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges. I faced some challanges at the start, with navigating around through each thing in the interface. 
The rest of my building journey was pretty smooth but then again some problems happened, but after all it was because I wasn't familiar with this software, nothing bad about the software itself. I would use this again for sure!
